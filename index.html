        One year has passed, and so has our age.</p><br><br>
        May blessings and spring fill the hall.<br><br>
        Let me introduce myself first. I am Mr Ng Guohui.<br><br>
        Let me introduce myself too; I am Ms Choo. <br>Mr Ng, it's the new year; how can we not say any blessings?<br><br>
        Of course. First, I wholeheartedly wish all staff of SST to be smooth sailing in their jobs, healthy, and happy!<br><br>
        I wish all staff of SST to have enough sleep, food and always be youthful and long-lived.<br><br>
        I also wish all students a great life, make great progress in studies, and the opportunity to become competent and good-looking!<br><br>
        I hope all students will study hard and be well-liked by others everywhere.<br><br>
        Congratulations all, Happy Lunar New Year (LNY)!<br><br>
        Since today is the eve of LNY, let us both sing a traditional song for all students and staff of SST.<br><br>
        The name of the song is &lt;New Year Song&gt;.<br><br>
        ðŸŽµEvery street and alley, and in everyone's mouth, the first thing being said is congratulations to you! ðŸŽµ<br><br>
        Wait, what are both of us congratulating each other like that for?<br><br>
        It is for us to grow a year older as the year passes.<br><br>
        So, are you saying that all of them grew older by a year?<br><br>
        No, it sounds so rude. I mean that everyone was safe and healthy in the previous year.<br><br>
        Actually, I prefer the following saying,<br><br>
        May blessings and spring fill the hall.<br><br>
        It can't be. Congratulations on a new year, spring and luck fill upâ€¦<br><br>
        And so do our red packets!<br><br>
        Let me test you; last year was the Year of the Dragon. Do you know what year it is now?<br><br>
        Of course, it is the Year of the Snake.<br><br>
        Do you know which year you were born in?<br><br>
        Of course, my zodiac animal is the snake, so this year is my Zodiac Year.<br><br>
        Actually, you did not even need to tell you. One look at you, and I know your zodiac is the snake.<br><br>
        Why?<br><br>
        You look like you have outgrown your snake head, snake eyes, snake brain, snake waist and even the python's legs.<br><br>
        Do I really look like a snake?<br><br>
        Not only do you look like one, but your personality is like one, too<br><br>
        Do you really understand me?<br><br>
        I have long seen through you; you are so timid. Has a snake bitten you before when you were young?<br><br>
        Yes, how did you know?<br><br>
        Once bitten, twice shy. Once you see a snake, you will be so afraid that you will shiver, right?<br><br>
        Yes, kind of.<br><br>
        Kind of? It's very; you are always so suspicious, always do extra things, and your words don't match your thoughts. (The Chinese proverbs are all relevant to the snake)<br><br>
        The way you say it makes me speechless; what is your zodiac?<br><br>
        My zodiac is also the snake.<br><br>
        Then whatever you said just now about me applies to you, too.<br><br>
        No, of course not; my type of snake is not the same as yours. Which month are you born in?<br><br>
        October, an October Snake<br><br>
        The October snake will already hibernate; how good can it be? I am a March Snake, so much better than you.<br><br>
        In what aspect?<br><br>
        You see, I have a brain smarter than a snake, have the courage of a snake swallowing an elephant, and write and play the instrument so skillfully. You say the dragon is brilliant, but it cannot even beat this snake.<br><br>
        Hey, once you talk about yourself, all the phrases are positive.<br><br>
        Yes.<br><br>
        Then what would my outlook this year be like?<br><br>
        For you, it's going to be excellent.<br><br>
        How so?<br><br>
        Think about it: your zodiac is the snake. If you earned $100000 last year, you will definitely earn $200000 this year.<br><br>
        Really?<br><br>
        If not? However, after the celebrations tonight, you must invite the audience to eat a sumptuous meal.<br><br>
        There you go again.<br><br>
        If you don't invite them, the $200000 will be gone. I'm afraid you will even be bitten by a snake this year on your birthday.<br><br>
        Ok, fine.
